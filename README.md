### Minimal requirement for minimal product

* Windows platform with IDE (Visual Studio 2017 and higher)
* GLM (https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
* Vulkan API (preferly 1.1.70, includes Vulkan-Hpp) (https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/)
* Vulkan memory allocator (https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator)

### Remark 11.03.2018

State GLSL compiler with SPIR-V tools works wrong (LunarG). Very recommended to recompile glslang with SPIR-V Tools.
