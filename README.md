### What we can be do, if we had desires

* Appveyor, etc. support 
* Some validation tests
* Suggestion for AMD GPUOpen partnership

### Features from carton box

* Based on Vulkan API (compute purpose)
* Simple vertex data loader for accelerator builder
* Optimized HLBVH acceleration structure 
* Optimized radix-sort (64/4-bits)
* Optimized ray tracing pipeline (tile-based)
* One testing example application (source code)
* Around 40MRays/s throughput in Sponza scenes (RX Vega 64)
* Windows platform support (not UWP), and modern hardwares (NVidia Pascal, Radeon Vega, and beyond)
