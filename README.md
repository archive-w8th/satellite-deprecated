# Satellite OEM (VK-1.1.70)

> Ray tracing source codes and SDK for making render and game engines (DIY). 

**08.03.2018**: Vulkan API 1.1.70 and SDK compilers still buggy, I merge very later. 

### Features from carton box

* Based on Vulkan API (compute purpose)
* Simple vertex data loader for accelerator builder
* Optimized HLBVH acceleration structure 
* Optimized radix-sort (64/4-bits)
* Optimized ray tracing pipeline (tile-based)
* One testing example application (source code)

### Minimal requirement for minimal product

* Windows platform with IDE (Visual Studio 2017 and higher)
* GLM (https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
* Shader compiler from LunarG 1.0.68 (don't know why)
* Vulkan API (preferly 1.1.70, includes Vulkan-Hpp) (https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/)
* Vulkan memory allocator (https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator)
