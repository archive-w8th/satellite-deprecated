### About cheats?

It should been said in 1 April, but... you can use any cheats, but it is useless for you, because there is nothing to cheat here. 

### What we can be do, if we had desires

* Appveyor, etc. support 
* Some validation tests
* Suggestion for AMD GPUOpen partnership

### Features from carton box

* Open Source for learning, experiments and forks 
* Based on Vulkan API 1.1 (compute purpose)
* API for vertex data usage and acceleration
* Optimized hlBVH<sup>2</sup> acceleration structure 
* Optimized radix-sort (64/4-bits)
* Optimized ray tracing pipeline (tile-based)
* Optimal precision and performance 
* One testing example application (source code)
* Around ~46MRays/s throughput in Sponza scenes (RX Vega 64)
* Windows platform (not UWP), and modern hardwares (NVidia Pascal, Radeon Vega, and beyond) support
