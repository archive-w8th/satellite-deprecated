### Alarm of New dawn... 

* **12.04.2018**. We can no actively support this project. We understand that we will no longer be able to support our old friend for a long time. Despite the adopted amendments to the draft, we understand that we are still weak in competition, and so far we can not enter the final market. We are thinking about creating a radically new project, but so far we do not even know what it will be like ... At first glance, this should be a correction of old and fundamental mistakes. But in our opinion it should be a complete change of the basic concept. 

### What we can be do, if we had desires

* Appveyor, etc. support 
* Some validation tests
* Suggestion for AMD GPUOpen partnership

### Features from carton box

* Open Source for learning, experiments and forks 
* Based on Vulkan API 1.1 (compute purpose)
* API for vertex data usage and acceleration
* Optimized hlBVH<sup>2</sup> acceleration structure 
* Optimized radix-sort (64/4-bits)
* Optimized ray tracing pipeline (tile-based)
* Optimal precision and performance 
* One testing example application (source code)
* Around ~46MRays/s throughput in Sponza scenes (RX Vega 64)
* Windows platform (not UWP), and modern hardwares (NVidia Pascal, Radeon Vega, and beyond) support
